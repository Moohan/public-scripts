== Classes
* Remove the tracker token, the player mat and the summon tokens from the character bags.
  Those will be ignored from the box.
  The tracker token will be generated from the tracker image in the class definition.
  The summon tokens and player mat will be generated from default components in the mod.
  The image for the player mat can be changed by defining one or multiple portraits for the class (see below).
