= Custom Content Box

The mod supports automatically unpacking custom content and placing it where it is required by the mod.
This makes it easier for users to set it up.
In order to use that feature the custom content has to be placed inside a bag that has the tag `Gloomhaven Custom Content` applied.
When this bag is spawned into the Gloomhaven Enhanced mod, it's content is checked and the objects are moved to where they are needed.
This is driven by the tags that are attached to objects inside the bag.
The following table lists the supported object types, as well as the required tags for them.

|===
| Object type | Tag | What happens

| Class envelope | `Class Envelope` | The envelope is placed at the end of the row for the base classes. If the envelope also has the `Locked Content` tag, it will be placed inside the "Locked Classes" envelope inside the Gloomhaven game box instead.
| Class Summon | `Summon` | It will be added to the bag of all summons. From there it can be spawned e.g. through the scripts from the Summon Cards.
| Personal Quests | `PersonalQuest` | It will be added to the bag for Personal Quests (as well as its backup).
| Scenario Token | `Scenario` | It will be registered as an available scenario. If the token als has the `Locked Content` tag, it will only be added internally as a locked scenario and has to be explicitly unlocked using the `ScenarioApi.unlockScenario` function.
| Monster Bag | `Enemy Envelope` | The envelope is added to the list of available monsters.
| City Event | `City Event` | The event is added to the Unlockable City Events bag (as well as its backup).
| Road Event | `Road Event` | The event is added to the Unlockable Road Events bag (as well as its backup).
| Corridor Overlay | `Corridor` | The overlay is added to the corridor bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Difficult Terrain Overlay | `Difficult Terrain` | The overlay is added to the difficult terrain bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Door Overlay | `Door` | The overlay is added to the door bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Hazardous Terrain Overlay | `Hazardous Terrain` | The overlay is added to the hazardous terrain bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Obstacle Overlay | `Obstacle` | The overlay is added to the obstacle bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Trap Overlay | `Trap` | The overlay is added to the trap bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Treasure Chest Overlay | `Treasure Chest` | The overlay is added to the treasure chest bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Map Tiles | `Map` | The overlay is added to the map tile bag on the table as well as the internal one required for scenario setup.
| Unlockable Treasure Cards | `Treasure` | The overlay is added to the internal bag required for scenario setup. It can be unlocked using the xref:common/action.adoc#Action_Treasure[Treasure-Action] within a scenario.
| Scenario Books | `Book` | The book is added to the book stand next to the game box.
| Reward Items | `Item` and `Item Reward` | The item will go into the reward items deck.
| Solo Reward Items | `Item` and `Item Solo Reward` | The item will go into the solo reward items deck.
| Item Designs | `Item` and `Item Design` | The item deck will go into the item designs deck. Item designs must be a deck of two items. The cards as well as the deck must have those tags.
| Unlocked Items | `Item` and none of the 3 special tags above | The item will go into shop deck
| Extra scenario content | `Scenario Extra Content` | The object will go into internal bag that can be used as xref:scenario.adoc#_extra_content[Extra content] inside scenario definitions.
| Monster ability decks | `Monster Ability Deck` | The object will go into an internal bag that can be used to change the ability deck used by monsters in a scenario
|===

Every object that hasn't one of those tags is ignored.
Any object that has one of those tags together with the `Locked Content` tag is also ignored (except for scenarios and class envelopes as stated above).
Objects within nested bags are also checked and moved accordingly.
E.g. a Summon figure inside a class envelope will also be considered.

NOTE: The objects won't actually be removed from the content box when this process happens.
They are basically cloned and put into the correct places.
If you have content that is automatically registered and content that isn't, you might consider separating them into different bags inside the content box.
This way it's easier for users to see, what they still have to place manually and what is already done for them.
