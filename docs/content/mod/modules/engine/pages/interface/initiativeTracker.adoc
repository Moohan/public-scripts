Clicking on an entry in the tracker marks it red which indicates that the turn of the character is monster type was completed.
Doing so for a character will also trigger end of turn looting for it.
E.g. if the character is currently standing on a coin or chest, clicking the entry on Initiative Tracker will move the coin/chest to the character's mat.

Clicking on the right arrow icon on a monster entry will show a preview of the ability card the monster type has drawn this round.
Each row is a separate action the monster performs.
If an area of effect attack is happening, another window will show the area.
