Name Name of the ability followed by its initiative value Description Full name of the class. The initiative value of a card has to be a two-digit number enclosed by parentheses (e.g. Perverse Edge (08)). When an ability has multiple initiative values (like the Blinkblade from Frosthaven), multiple parentheses can be used. The initiative tracker then shows all of them and users can remove them if needed. Within the class box the ability cards then need to be placed into a deck. The deck needs to be named Starting Abilities for abilities that are unlocked by the class at level 1. All those cards will be put the players' hand when a new character is created. All other ability cards need to be in a deck named Advanced Abilities. This ensures that the Campaign Manager can correctly find them. Abilities only need a script, when it’s an ability that can spawn Summons. The script adds a button to the card that can be clicked and creates the Summon figure. The Summon also needs to be registered accordingly.

The third parameter is a thumbnail image for the summon to be used in the Context Menu. Name Unique name across all Summons. Tags Required tags will be set automatically through the script. Summons need to be inside a Custom Content Box to be registered correctly. Add this script to a Summons' figure script and adjust the shown values to your need. Figures/Summon.ttslua stats = { health = 2, move = 3, attack = 0, range = 0, attributes = {} } info = { hpColour = \"#AD735C\" } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.Summon\") The stats table describes the base stats for the Summon. The values should be self-explanatory. The attributes table describes the default attributes the summon has (like flying, shield or infusing an element). The format is the same as for Enemy Stats. The info table and the FrameOffset use the same format as the one for the class Figure. Add this script to figure’s UI script. No other values need to be set. Figures/Summon.xml Within the class envelope LUA, you can define other objects contained in the tuck box to automatically unpack with the class. This function takes two parameters: * The NAME of the object * The TARGET area within the player zone where the object should be placed * Valid values for TARGET are \"Hand\", \"HandTwo\", \"CharacterMat\", and \"CharacterSheet\" * You can specify a specific position relative to their target To easily get the position in the local coordinate system you can place the object where you want it and then paste that into the chat window: How to find a relative position value --Replace \"targetObjectGUID\" with the GUID where you want to place your object (e.g. the Player Mat) and \"objectGUID\" with the GUID of the extra object /execute print(logString(getObjectFromGUID(\"targetObjectGUID\").positionToLocal(getObjectFromGUID(\"objectGUID\").getPosition()))) An example looks as follows: Extra class content extra = { { name = \"Special Rules\", target = \"CharacterSheet\", }, { name = \"Special Overlay Tokens\", target = { PlayerMat = { 1, 0, 1 }} }, }, Registration of the class is done via the ClassApi.registerClass function.

Effects can also be used to add additional images for movement types, or area of effects. Registering an Effect is similar to a condition. In fact, every Condition is also an Effect (so you don’t have to register it twice). The registration is done via the registerEffect function in the ConditionApi. The attributes are similar to registering a Condition. A difference is that the name is part of the table and not the first parameter to the function call. Also Effects currently don’t use the max attribute. Either an image or a text has to be supplied. If the image is supplied, it will be shown when the Effect is active.

The table below lists the supported object types, as well as the required tags for them. Additionally, each content box needs to have a simple script attached to it, which describes some metadata for the content. The mod uses this metadata to determine if the content is compatible with the current version or check for updates for the content. The content box needs to have (at least) the following script attached in order to work with the mod. The script defines a function named getMetadata which returns a table with the basic metadata of the content. function getMetadata() return { -- The version of the content version = \"1.0.0\", -- The author of the content.

Any object that has one of those tags together with the Locked Content tag is also ignored (except for scenarios as stated above). Objects within nested bags are also checked and moved accordingly. E.g. a Summon figure inside a class envelope will also be considered. The objects won’t actually be removed from the content box when this process happens. They are basically cloned and put into the correct places. If you have content that is automatically registered and content that isn’t, you might consider separating them into different bags inside the content box. This way it’s easier for users to see, what they still have to place manually and what is already done for them. If the Metadata contains a URL to the changelog of a content, the mod will load it to check for the latest version of a content. If there’s a newer version for the content than the currently loaded one, the users will get an update notification (just like a regular mod update). The file MUST be a JSON file and have a specific format. If the format doesn’t match, the mod might raise errors during load. The JSON file contains of a single list, where each entry in the list represents one version of the content (so it keeps on growing with each release). Each release entry has some metadata about the released version, like the release date, the version number and the actual changes. Below is an example file for a changelog. Another (real live) example is the changelog for the mod itself. [ { // The version of the content. Must follow semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) as the mod assumes this format. \"version\": \"1.2.0\", // Release date of the content. Must have the Format YYYY-MM-DD. // If empty, the mod ignores this entry. This is useful to expand the file while developing the content // without the mod showing up a notification. \"release\": \"\", // A list of changes with different keys (here add for added features). // See below for supported keys \"add\": [ \"This is the text that will show up in the notification window.\" ] }, // example of the latest released version { \"version\": \"1.1.0\", \"nickname\": \"My cool name\", \"release\": \"2024-09-12\", \"change\": [ \"The thing now works differently\" ], \"add\": [ \"A new thing was added.\", \"Another cool thing was added.\" ], // Another list of changes to describe fixes \"fix\": [ \"Fixed that thing\", ], \"migration\": [ \"Change the name of that thing before migrating.\" ] }, { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"nickname\": \"Initial Release\", \"release\": \"\", } ] NOTE Be sure to NOT include any comments in the JSON like in the example above. Those are just for documentation purpose and parsing the JSON file will break, if it contains any comments. Changes can be described in list with different keys. Each key has a different role to group changes into certain categories. The following keys are supported: breaking List any breaking changes of the content. This means the users typically needs to actively change something in order for the content to still function. E.g. this could mean the content now requires a new minimum version of the mod, so the user needs to migrate to that new mod version first, before continuing using the content. Following semantic versioning, a breaking change also means the major version needs to be increased for this version (e.g. going from 1.2.0 to 2.0.0). deprecate Describes features that shouldn’t be used anymore. A future version of the content will remove that feature so this give users a heads-up. Typically, this also means there’s a new way or new feature that replaces the old one, and it should be described here. change A feature that changed compared to the previous version. add A feature that was added to this version. fix A bug that was fixed with this version. known A list of known bugs/behavior for this version. migration Additional information that is relevant for migrating the content to the new version.

It’s sole function is to group all objects belonging to a single enemy type. Name Full name of the enemy. Tags Enemy Envelope This is an infinite bag containing the Figure for the enemy. It will be placed on the monster mat and new enemies will be spawned from the bag. Name Full name of the enemy followed by \" Standee\", e.g. \"Bandit Archer Standee\" The Enemy Bag is currently the best place to register the enemy. This is typically done in two steps. First the enemy’s ability deck has to be registered. This is done by calling EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck. It takes the name of the ability deck and the list of abilities it includes. The abilities can have two attributes: An image with the link to the image for this ability card. This value isn’t used for 1.3 yet, so it can also be ignored. It will be used for future versions, e.g. to the show the active ability card of an enemy in the initiative tracker. A spawn element, describing which object the ability can spawn (like traps or summoning other enemies). Documentation about the proper attributes for this element can be found here This part should be skipped, if the enemy uses an ability deck that is already registered in the game. This is the case for all decks from the Gloomhaven base game. Example 1. Registration for the \"Archer\" enemy ability deck api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck(\"Archer\", { abilities = { [1] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-1.png\", }, -- abilities 2 till 6 would be here too [7] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-7.png\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, }, } }, }, [8] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-8.png\", }, } } Once the ability deck is registered, the actual enemy type has to be registered, to connect the enemy to the ability deck. This is done by calling EnemyApi.registerEnemy. This function takes the name of the enemy type and two named parameters: icon is the link to an image for an icon of this enemy type. This is currently used in the Context Menu, when the enemy can be summoned by other enemies. abilityDeck is the name of a previously registered ability deck. This tells the mod that this enemy uses the ability deck with this name. Example 2. Registration of the \"Bandit Archer\" enemy. api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") EnemyApi.registerEnemy(\"Bandit Archer\", { icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1688272925075790807/F181B084F5CA91BC0E0F75C682C6993C4BCBDA43/\", abilityDeck = \"Archer\", }) If the enemy is a boss enemy, another API has to be used instead: EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy. Since all bosses use the same ability deck, this is where their abilities are defined (e.g. which elements they can spawn). The spawn element works the same as for registerEnemyAbilityDeck and details can be found here. api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy(\"Bandit Commander\", { icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1688272925075790870/264D1A7A6C93A37894B204DD6CDB555F11B8B5BD/\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"Living Bones\", }, }, }, }) Name Full name of the enemy type. Description Must be empty. Tags Enemy (will also be set by the script). Put the following Lua script on the Figure. The value for FrameOffset defines where the HP will be placed at. Adjust the value to fit the model. You can use this tool to easily try out different values. Figures/Monster.ttslua FrameOffset = 260 require(\"Figures.Monster\") Figures/Monster.xml Name Full name of the enemy followed by \" Stat Sheet\", e.g. \"Bandit Archer Stat Sheet\". Tags MonsterStatSheet Within the script of the Stats-Sheet the stats for the different levels are defined as well as how many figures can be present for this enemy type. To define the maximum number of enemies, declare a variable named count. Put the following script on the Stats-Sheet and adjust the values accordingly. Example 3. Defining the maximum number of figures. StatSheet.ttslua count = 4 require(\"StatSheet\") The stats per level are declared using the variable named stats. This variable is a table of stat entries, one per level. You can use a numeric index, to more easily set the values per level. Example 4. General structure of the stats variable StatSheet.ttslua stats = { [0] = { -- Level 0 stats go here [1] = { -- Level 1 stats go here } -- etc. } require(\"StatSheet\") The entry for each level has an attribute named orientation and the attributes normal and elite. In case of a boss enemy the level has an attribute boss instead of normal and elite. The orientation attribute defines the rotation of the Stat-Sheets object that shows that stats for this level. This is used by the mod to figure out which level is currently set on the Stats-Sheet by checking the current orientation of the object with the entries defined here. StatSheet.ttslua stats = { [0] = { orientation = {0, 180, 0}, normal = { -- stats for normal version go here }, elite = { -- stats for elite version go here }, boss = { -- this is used by bosses instead of the above two } }, } require(\"StatSheet\") Within normal, elite or boss the actual stats have to be defined. Checkout Stats for the available attributes. Example 5. More complete example of the Stats-Sheet script. StatSheet.ttslua -- maximum number of standees for this enemy type count = 4; -- stats per level stats = { [0] = { -- this is the orientation the stat that shows the level orientation = {0, 180, 0}, -- stats for the normal version normal = { health = 8, move = 3, attack = 2, range = 0, attributes = {} }, -- stats for the elite version elite = { health = 13, move = 3, attack = 3, range = 0, attributes = {} } }, -- same for level 1 [1] = { orientation = {0, 90, 0}, normal = { health = 9, move = 3, attack = 2, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\" } }, elite = { health = 15, move = 3, attack = 3, range = 0, attributes = { \"Wound\" } } }, -- level 2 and 3 omitted [4] = { -- level 4 is the same, but now the back of the stat sheet is used, -- so the rotation on the z-axis has to be changed to account for that orientation = {0, 180, 180}, normal = { health = 16, move = 3, attack = 4, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\" } }, elite = { health = 24, move = 4, attack = 4, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\", \"Wound\" } } }, -- and so on until level 7 } require(\"StatSheet\"); The Ability Deck contains the different Ability Cards. Name Name of the Ability Deck (e.g. \"Archer\"). Each Ability Card within the Ability Deck needs to have a special naming structure and the Monster Ability Card tag. Name Name of the Ability Deck (e.g. \"Archer\"). Description Definition of the initiative (see below). The description field is used to encode the initiative values(s) and the action(s) the enemy takes. Each entry has to start with an initiative value followed by a colon and a space. The initiative value needs to have a leading zero if it’s below 10. After the colon, the textual description can be added. This is used in the initiative tracker to show what the enemy is doing. Multiple actions can be defined by using a semicolon. Those will show up as separate lines in the initiative tracker. 31: Move +0; Attack +0 For abilities that shuffle the ability cards, add shuffle after the initiative. 15 shuffle: Move +1; Attack +1 If the ability grants multiple actions at different initiatives, you can use new lines. Each line will add an entry to the initiative tracker. 03: Attack +0 11: Move +0 20: Attack +0 To use icons in the initiative tracker, you must change your player color to black and update the GM Note instead of the Description field. You can use the following text for icons: {e.Attack} {e.Move} {e.Heal} {e.Loot} {e.Shield} {e.Retaliate} {e.Range} {e.Target} {e.Damage} {e.Jump} {e.Fly} {e.Teleport} {e.Generate Fire} {e.Generate Ice} {e.Generate Air} {e.Generate Earth} {e.Generate Light} {e.Generate Dark} {e.Generate Any} {e.Consume Fire} {e.Consume Ice} {e.Consume Air} {e.Consume Earth} {e.Consume Light} {e.Consume Dark} {e.Consume Any} You can also include an icon for any custom registered effect or condition using {e.} or {c.} respectively. 03: {e.Attack}+0 11: {e.Move}+0 55: {c.Poison} You can add other custom conditions/effects, as long as they are already part of the Markazi Gloom Color font by Dimon-II. To add them, the registerCondition and registerEffect functions allow a new entry called renderedMarkup which takes any string. Whatever you put there will be shown in the preview whenever the markup for this Condition/Effect is used. There are already helper via the new UiApi where you only need to provide the glyph and color used for the condition. E.g. for a condition, all you need to do is to find the correct glyph in the font and insert it into the first parameter of UiApi.conditionText \\u{}. The color for the condition as hex value is the second parameter. Example 6. How to add Safeguard as a custom condition: local UiApi = require(\"api.UiApi\") ConditionApi.registerCondition(\"Safeguard\", { image = \"...\", immunity = { ... }, renderedMarkup = UiApi.conditionText(\"\\u{E09D}\", \"#5B9977\"), }) You can include an AoE \"Area\" which will display an AoE pattern in the initiative tracker. This can be designated using {area.} with specific syntax to create the intended pattern: s will create a grey \"self\" hex t will create a red \"enemy\" hex a will create a blue \"ally\" hex e will create a blank space with no hex _ will begin a new row, every even row will be automatically intented by half a hex Example 7. Wind Demon’s ability with two areas: -- first row: empty hex and two target hexes -- second row: the self hex and a target hex {area.ett_st} -- second area {area.ett_stt_ett} Stats for enemies and summons have the following structure. local stats = { -- The maximum health values health = 8, -- The base move value move = 3, -- The base attack value attack = 2, -- The base range value range = 0, -- A list of extra effect like retaliate shield attributes = { }, -- A list of immunities immunities = { }, -- A text that will be shown below the healthbar -- This can be used for describing what a variable means, e.g. on a boss -- like, \"V is the number of ...\" text = \"\", } This attribute takes a single value. For Boss enemies this can also be a string in the form of \"8xC\", which will calculate the value based on player count. A Formula is currently not supported. The move attribute can either be a simple value (a number or string like above), or a table with the attributes value and type. The attribute value determines how for the figure can move and the type determines the movement type (e.g. for flying enemies). The value for this field can the name of any registered Effect, but generally should be \"Fly\", \"Jump\", or \"Teleport\". -- A flying enemy move = { value = 3, type = \"Fly\" } The attack attribute functions similar. It can take a simple value or a table with the attributes value and area. The attribute value determines the attack value of the figure the area attribute is the name of an Effect. The image for this Effect will be shown next to the attack value. Its purpose is to show the attack area for this figure, but it could be used for any other effect as well. -- An enemy with a special attack area attack = { value = 3, area = \"Area X\" } The immunities field is a list of Effects this figure is immune to. immunities = { \"Poison\", \"Pull\", \"Curse\", \"Stun\" } The attributes field describes extra attributes for the enemy, like if it has a shield value, or retaliated damage or always applies a certain condition. It’s a list that can contain three kinds of different values: A simple string. This is the name of any registered Effect, e.g. \"Generate Air\", \"Muddle\" or \"Curse\" A name, value pair. The name is the name of any registered effect and the value is the value for this Effect, e.g. \"Shield = 2\" or \"Retaliate = 2\". This will show the image for the Effect followed by a text with this value. A name with a table that has the attributes value and range. This is used for retaliated damage that has a range. It will show the image for the Retaliate Effect and it’s value, followed by the image for Range and it’s value. While this is currently only used for Retaliate, this format can be used for any other Effect as well. attributes = { -- the name of an Effect \"Generate Air\", -- the name of an Effect and it's value Shield = 2, -- short for for Retaliate, if the range is 1 Retaliate = 2, -- special form for Retaliate, with a range greater than 1 Retaliate = { value = 2, range = 2 }, } This text will be shown below the figure and can be used to describe special variables or specific effects for this figure.","title":"Enemies","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"enemy","url":"/custom/latest/enemy.html","titles":[{"text":"Components","hash":"_components","id":1},{"text":"Enemy Envelope","hash":"_enemy_envelope","id":2},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":3},{"text":"Enemy Bag","hash":"_enemy_bag","id":4},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":5},{"text":"Lua Script","hash":"_lua_script","id":6},{"text":"Figure","hash":"_figure","id":7},{"text":"Lua Script","hash":"_lua_script_2","id":8},{"text":"Xml Ui","hash":"_xml_ui","id":9},{"text":"Stats-Sheet","hash":"_stats_sheet","id":10},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_3","id":11},{"text":"Lua Script","hash":"_lua_script_3","id":12},{"text":"Ability Deck","hash":"_ability_deck","id":13},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_4","id":14},{"text":"Ability Card","hash":"_ability_card","id":15},{"text":"Stats","hash":"_stats","id":16},{"text":"Health","hash":"_health","id":17},{"text":"Move","hash":"_move","id":18},{"text":"Attack","hash":"_attack","id":19},{"text":"Immunities","hash":"_immunities","id":20},{"text":"Attributes","hash":"_attributes","id":21},{"text":"Text","hash":"_text","id":22}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"TODO","title":"Extension","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"extensions","url":"/custom/latest/extensions.html","titles":[]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This documentation describes how custom content can be integrated into the Frosthaven Enhanced mod.

Tag Specific tag for the overlay type (see Overlay Type). If you want to also add a 3D representation for the overlay you have to add a new state for it (see the TTS knowledge base for more info). By convention the first state is for the 2D token and the second state for the 3D token. You can also have more than 2 states. In this case, when the overlay is placed a random state is determined for each overlay during load. E.g. in the mod the tree overlay has 3 different 3D models and one will be chosen randomly for each tree overlay token placed in a scenario. There are two kind of overlay scripts: Overlay and BasicOverlay. The difference between them is that the first one supports adding HP bars to the overlay whereas the second one only supports adding buttons for [Actions] (like the \"Open\" button for doors). Traps have their own script that has to added. The script has to be added to all object states of the overlay token (possibly with different parameters). Within the script two parameters have to be adjusted. The parameter for withFrameOffset is the height where an HP bar will appear. The parameter for withButtonPosition is the height where a button for [Actions] will appear. The correct position probably has to be found through testing.

The mod itself contains the information of how to use the builder to generate a scenario. However, the builder currently only supports a subset of features the scenario definition is able to provide. E.g. it can’t set HP values for overlays, named enemies or loot effects from treasure chests. To add those features to a scenario, you can edit the generated scenario definition from the Scenario Builder. This, this section contains the documentation about the structure of the scenario definition. When you want to add or change some features, you need to understand this structure and make those changes accordingly. In the Concrete use-cases section you can also find examples for specific use-cases to give you an idea on where to start. This section is currently not well documented. A lot of features are missing…​ The scenario builder creates a token, that contains the scenario definition within its script. To adjust the scenario definition, the script has to be changed. The script on the tokens looks like this: ## -- some more lines above this one __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- this is where the actual code lies local ScenarioApi = require(\"api.ScenarioApi\") function onLoad() -- when the token is placed on the table, the scenario will be added -- to the list of available scenarios -- the first parameter \"Custom Scenario\" here is a unique id across all -- scenarios. In the scenario setup this will be the prefix in the list, -- e.g. \"SoX1 - The Name of SoX1 Scenario\" ScenarioApi.registerScenario(\"Custom Scenario\", { -- this is the scenario definition from the scenario builder -- it can be adjusted to add new features }) return end end) __bundle_register(\"api.ScenarioApi\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- more stuff after this one as well, that must be untouched To change the scenario definition, change the content between {} in the function call to registerScenario. You should also change the scenario ID (the first parameter of the function call, e.g. Custom Scenario in the example above). This ID needs to be unique across all scenarios. The ID can also be used to quickly spawn the scenario without using the Game Setup menu. Enter >spawn-scenario into the chat window (e.g. >spawn-scenario Custom Scenario given the example above). This will delete everything in the scenario play area as well as all monsters and then spawn the new scenario after a short delay. While this is mainly used for developing purposes, there’s nothing stopping you from using it in your gaming sessions as well. Collapse the following example to get an overview of the overall scenario definition structure. The different parts are explained in more details in the following sections. Example of all the general scenario definition structure { -- The name of the scenario name = \"Black Barrow\", -- Optional icon which shows to the left of the scenario name in the Game Setup menu, typically for Solo Scenarios icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/111111111111111111/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/\", -- The scenario book used by this scenario scenarioBook = { name = \"Gloomhaven\", page = 3, }, -- A list of scenario conclusion tiles that can be revealed, when the scenario is finished scenarioConclusions = { { image = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1752439086837779719/8C6A36C4FDB88BCB7B012F7121A2DB8E1876D0B3/\", scale = { 1.50, 1.00, 1.50 }, buttonLabel = \"Reveal Conclusion (36)\" }, }, -- Whether the overlays are placed on a horizontal or vertical grid gridType = ScenarioApi.GridType.Horizontal, -- Adjustments to monsters inside the scenario, e.g. a changed ability deck, -- another monster level or different stats monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { levelModifier = 1, } } }, -- Registered extra content that should be placed when the scenario loads. -- Used as a fallback to include all kind of crazyness extraContent = { { name = \"Extra Stuff\", position = { 0, 3, 0 }, } }, -- The list of doors connecting the different rooms doorTiles = { { name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", tiles = { { rooms = { 2, 3 }, position = { x = -1.75, y = 1.82, z = 6.06 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 }, tokens = { \"1\" }, } } }, { name = \"Stone Door Vertical\", tiles = { -- } } }, -- The list of rooms in the scenario, each containing their overlays, monsters and map tiles rooms = { [1] = { -- The list of used map tiles mapTiles = { { tile = \"L1\", position = { x = 0.9, y = -3.77, z = -3.03 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 } } }, -- The list of scenario section tiles that will be placed for this room scenarioSections = { { image = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1752439086836487818/4256434230672E8FBFFA1CBE7C1A93984DF2EA95/\", position = { -28.44, 1.75, 21.98 }, scale = { 0.69, 1.00, 0.69 }, hidden = true, buttonLabel = \"Section 02\", }, }, -- The list of overlays that are start tiles startTiles = { name = \"Stone Corridor 1\", tiles = { { position = { x = -0.43, y = 1.93, z = -5.30 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 } }, } }, -- The list of placed monsters monsters = { { name = \"Bandit Guard\", tiles = { { numCharacters = { [2] = ScenarioApi.MonsterLevel.Elite, [3] = nil, [4] = nil }, position = { x = 0.87, y = 2.06, z = -1.51 }, }, } } }, -- The list of placed overlays overlayTiles = { { bag = ScenarioApi.OverlayType.Trap, type = { { name = \"Spike Trap\", tiles = { { position = { x = -0.43, y = 1.93, z = 6.81 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 }, }, } } } }, }, }, [2] = { -- another room } }, -- A list of all monster types that are included in this scenario (including summons) monsterList = { \"Bandit Archer\", \"Bandit Guard\", \"Living Bones\" } } The scenarioBook property defines which scenario book should be used for the scenario. It has a name property which must match the tag of a registered scenario book. The page property defines which page will be opened, inside the scenario book. This page will be offset by 1 as it assumes each scenario book has a front cover that is not included in the page numbering. E.g. if the scenario book is opened with a PDF viewer, the viewer would show page number 4, but the definition would include page number 3. If the scenario spawns two pages of the scenario book, the property pageCount can be set to 2. More than 2 pages are currently not supported and are probably never required anyway. scenarioBook = { -- The scenario book to use name = \"Gloomhaven\", -- The page that will be opened inside the book page = 3, -- If 2 pages should be shown, set this value as well pageCount = 2, } The sectionBook property defines which section book should be used for the scenario. It has a name property which must match the tag of a registered section book. The sections property defines which sections from the book are relevant for this scenario. The mod will use this information to figure out which pages it needs to spawn from the book. Each determined page will spawn as a separate book at a fixed position. Only the buttons for the defined sections will be active, all other sections in the book will simply be black without a button. local scenario = { sectionBook = { -- the tag on the section book object name = \"Gloomhaven\", -- The list of sections that should be used for this scenario -- Determines which buttons will be shown and which pages will spawn sections = { -- the id values is the value shown in the button { id = \"2A\" }, { id = \"2B\" }, { id = \"3A\" }, } } } It’s possible to define extra attributes, stats, immunities or their used ability deck for all monsters of a given type as part of the scenario definition. It is possible to distinguish between normal and elite monsters as well. The general structure looks like this: local scenario = { monsters = { -- the name of the monster as the key [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { -- settings applied to all Bandit Guards }, normal = { -- settings additionally applied to all normal Bandit Guards }, elite = { -- settings additionally applied to all elite Bandit Guards } }, -- another monster [\"Bandit Archer\"] = { -- same structure as above } } -- rest of scenario definition } The settings from all are applied to all monsters that are spawned for this type. Settings in normal/elite then are additionally applied to monsters of the given difficulty. All entries follow the same structure and look like this: all = { -- The ability deck to use. If not used it will use the monsters default -- ability deck abilityDeck = \"Archer\", -- A modifier that should be applied to the current scenario level. -- This will make the monsters stronger/weaker. It can be a Formula. levelModifier = 1, -- The current HP value for the monster. If hpMax is not used, this is also -- the maximum HP value. -- It can be a Formula. Use the variable \"H\" or \"this\" to reference the -- default HP value for this monster. hp = { \"+\", \"H\", 3 }, -- The maximum HP value for the monster. -- It can be a Formula. Use the variable \"H\" or \"this\" to reference the -- default maximum HP value for this monster. hpMax = { \"+\", \"this\", 3 }, -- Adjusted stats for the monster stats = { -- Adjusted immunities immunities = { -- Immunities that will be added to the monster. add = { \"Stun\", \"Muddle\", \"Poison\" }, -- Immunities that will be removed from the monster. remove = { \"Curse\" }, }, attributes = { -- Attributes that will be added to the monster. If the monster already -- has the attribute, it will be overwritten with this definition. -- The format is the same as for general Stats. -- The values currently can not be Formula, only fixed values. add = { \"Muddle\", Pierce = 3, Retaliate = { value = 2, range = 2, }, }, -- Attributes that will be removed from the monster. remove = { \"Shield\", \"Wound\" }, }, -- The adjusted attack value. Can be a formula, where the variable \"this\" -- refers to the default attack value for this monster (at its current -- level). attack = { \"+\", \"this\", 1 }, range = { \"+\", \"this\", 1 }, -- The adjusted move value. Can be a formula, where the variable \"this\" -- refers to the default move value for this monster (at its current -- level). move = { type = \"Flying\", }, -- The text that will show below the monster. text = \"New Text\", } } The same structure can be applied to an individual monster as well, e.g. to overwrite the stats of a single monster of a given type. The following example demonstrates this: local scenario = { monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Poison\" } }, } }, elite = { stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Wound\" } }, }, attributes = { add = { \"Muddle\" } }, } } }, rooms = { [1] = { monsters = { { name = \"Bandit Guard\", tiles = { { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Position immunity from all numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Normal }, }, { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Wound immunity from elite -- and the Muddle attack effect from elite. -- The immunity from all is overwritten by the immunities from -- elite numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Elite }, }, { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Muddle attack effect from elite -- and a Stun immunity from its own definition. -- The immunities from all and elite are overwritten by its own -- definition numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Elite }, stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Stun\" } }, }, }, } } } } } } While it is possible to define the used ability deck on all levels presented above, it’s only useful to use it within the definition of all. It’s not possible to have the same monster type with different ability decks, so the first monster that spawns defines the used ability deck for all monsters of that type. And if the \"Preload Enemies\" option is used to prepare all monsters in a scenario at its start, the settings for those prepared monsters is only defined by all (as those don’t have a difficulty setting). Similar to the Monsters option, you can spawn scenario specific figures which perform the same action each round. This is commonly used for named allies or unique basic enemies. These figures require a standee model which can be based on any existing summon or enemy, or you can register a custom figure (objects with the \"Figure\" tag included within a \"Gloomhaven Custom Content\" bag). Figures figures = { [\"Mechanical Turret\"] = { --name of the Summon, Enemy, or registered Figure object to use as a standee basedOn = \"Ancient Artillery\", --possible base values are \"Normal\" (White), \"Elite\" (Yellow), \"Ally\" (Blue), \"Boss\" (Red) and \"Named\" (Purple) base = \"Normal\", stats = { health = 10, attributes = { add = { Shield = 1 }, }, immunities = { add = { \"Poison\" }, }, }, ability = { initiative = 50, ability = \"{e.Attack}3 {e.Range}4\", }, }, }, When placing a figure within a room, you can also exclude it from spawning with different player counts. Placed Figures figures = { [1] = { name = \"Mechanical Turret\", position = { x = '15.15', y = '1.76', z = '-8.75', }, rotation = { x = '0.00', y = '180.00', z = '0.00', }, characterCount = { [2] = R.Remove, [3] = R.Remove, }, }, }, You can define the conditions and name for overlays, commonly used for traps: Overlays overlays = { --This is the original overlay tile's name. [\"Bear Trap\"] = { --These are the trap conditions applied when triggered. conditions = { \"Damage\" }, --This is the new name given to all overlays of this type when spawned durign scenario setup. name = \"Damage Trap\", }, }, You can add a Scenario Aid token to an object’s UI, or even include a health bar: Objectives overlayTiles = { { bag = R.ElementType.Obstacle, type = { { name = \"Rock Column\", tiles = { { position = { x = -1.31, y = 1.87, z = 9.85, }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, }, name = \"Summoning Stone\", tokens = { \"a\" }, hp = {\"+\", \"C\", 1}, }, }, }, }, }, }, For a complete list of actions available, see Common > Actions: https://gloomhaven-tts-enhanced.github.io/public-scripts/custom/1.3/common/action.html. You can add a Treasure action to an object (typically a treasure chest) to spawn the card defined as treasure: Treasure action = { name = \"50\", treasure = \"Treasure 50\", }, You can set the chest as a scenario goal as well: Treasure (G) action = { treasure = \"G\", }, You can add an action to an objective to act as a door. Triggering this can be used to reveal hidden rooms or spawn additional enemies: Door/Rooms action = { rooms = { 6, 2 } } You may need to add tags to an overlay or standee when it’s spawned so that you can build actions to interact with it. A common use is to remove the object as part of an action. Adding tags to an object overlayTiles = { { bag = R.ElementType.Obstacle, type = { { name = \"Nest\", tiles = { { position = { x = 3.94, y = 1.86, z = 6.82, }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, }, tags = {\"Scenario X Nest 1\"}, }, }, }, }, }, }, Some scenarios require to place some objects randomly during setup, e.g. placing objective tokens face down or spawn the content of a random dungeon card. To handle this, you need to define a randomPools, and randomObjects within a room. Random pools are defined at the top level of the scenario. Give them a name, and the type shown below. In the values attributes you can define the list of tokens you want to use. Adding a pool of random tokens randomPools = { { name = \"Some name\", type = ScenarioApi.RandomType.Tokens, values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 }, } }, Then inside a room, you can add the new randomObjects property and add a list of things that can randomly be placed there. Use the property pool to reference the pool of random objects from above and the position where the object shall be placed. Define the locations where the random objects may be spawned rooms = { [1] = { randomObjects = { { -- one possible position for a token from Pool \"Some name\" pool = \"Some name\", position = { ... }, }, { -- another possible position for a token from Pool \"Some name\" pool = \"Some name\", position = { ... }, }, -- and so on } } }, As a fallback mechanism extra scenario components can be defined. This is meant to easily supply objects that are currently not supported through scripting (e.g. monsters that use different attack modifier decks). Those first have to be registered inside a Custom Content Box. Then inside the scenario definition, they can be references by their name and be placed at a specific position. It’s possible to define the extra components on the top-level of the scenario and also on each room. When defined on the top-level the components will spawn, once the scenario is loaded. Components defined on a room are loaded once the rooms is opened. Both entries are lists, so they can define multiple components. local scenario = { -- can be defined on the top level extraContent = { -- one entry { -- The name of the registered extra component name = \"Extra Stuff\", -- The position where the content will spawn position = { 10, 2, 10 }, }, -- a second entry { -- .. }, }, rooms = { [2] = { -- Or as part of a room extraContent = { { name = \"More Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } } } } } The examples in this section create a local variable named scenario. This contains the relevant part of the scenario definition for the example and is the part that would be passed to registerScenario. Changes the ability deck monsters will use. -- The Bandit Guards use the Archer ability deck instead of their own Guard deck local scenario = { monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { abilityDeck = \"Archer\" } } } } Loads additional components as a fall-back that are currently not supported with scripting (also known as \"asshole bags\"). local scenario = { -- This will be placed together with the scenario extraContent = { { name = \"Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } }, rooms = { [2] = { -- This will be placed, once the room 2 will be opened extraContent = { { name = \"More Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } } } } }","title":"Scenarios","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"scenario","url":"/custom/latest/scenario.html","titles":[{"text":"Basics","hash":"_basics","id":1},{"text":"General scenario definition structure","hash":"_general_scenario_definition_structure","id":2},{"text":"Scenario books","hash":"_scenario_books","id":3},{"text":"Section Books","hash":"_section_books","id":4},{"text":"Default Monster Settings","hash":"_default_monster_settings","id":5},{"text":"Figures","hash":"_figures","id":6},{"text":"Overlays","hash":"_overlays","id":7},{"text":"Objectives","hash":"_objectives","id":8},{"text":"Actions","hash":"_actions","id":9},{"text":"Frequently used actions","hash":"_frequently_used_actions","id":10},{"text":"Tags","hash":"_tags","id":11},{"text":"Randomly placed objects","hash":"_randomly_placed_objects","id":12},{"text":"Extra content","hash":"_extra_content","id":13},{"text":"Concrete use-cases","hash":"_concrete_use_cases","id":14},{"text":"Custom monster ability decks","hash":"_custom_monster_ability_decks","id":15},{"text":"Extra content","hash":"_extra_content_2","id":16}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"Most custom content requires some script, that is either added directly to the content or tells the mod about the content. Generally, you have two ways to work with the scripts. Either through an external tool (the VS Code text editor), or the scripting window inside TTS. The first method is the preferred way. While it requires a bit of setup, it’s a lot easier to continuously work on custom content with it. E.g. it will be a lot easier to update the scripts of the content to the latest version used by the mod without the need to copy and paste a lot of code and unpacking deeply nested bags in TTS (heck you can do everything without TTS if you want, even releasing the custom content mod). The alternative is to use the TTS scripting window. For this you need to download the latest script from the releases. After you downloaded the scripts from the latest release, you’ll find two folders inside there: base and bundled. You’ll need the bundled folder to work with the TTS scripting window. Extract the required folder somewhere in you file system. Download and install Node.js. Download and install VS Code. Create a new directory for your custom content project, where you want to work on it. Download the package.json file and put that into the directory. Open VS Code and open the directory. This can be done by using the menu File Open Folder…​ or by dragging the directory onto the workspace in VS Code. Install the extension \"npm\" by clicking on the menu with four blocks on the left bar. Locate the save file you want to edit inside the TTS save directory (checkout the knowledge base to find the default locations for your system). It can either be a regular save or a saved object. Copy the name of the save file (e.g. TS_Save_1072 for regular saves or Artificier if you have a saved object with this name). Open the package.json file in your working directory. Change the two occurrences of , to the name of the save file. E.g. with the save file name TS_Save_1072, the section would look like this: After you installed the above-mentioned npm extension, you’ll have the following section in the explorer in VS Code It may be not at the top, but below other sections. You can reorder sections by using drag 'n' drop. If the section doesn’t show up at all, right-click on the heading of any other section and enable it. Hover over the setup entry and click the Play button that show’s up. Afterwards, do the same with the update entry. This will download the latest scripts for the Gloomhaven enhanced mod. This completes the (rather-long) setup, and you’re good to go. :-) If you have multiple save files you are working on, it’s recommended to have a different directories for all of them. This way you don’t have to edit the package.json around. To start working on the save file, press the Play button on the entry extract inside the npm section. This will basically copy the save file from your TTS save file location and split it into multiple files inside the Contents directory if your current working directory. E.g a (reduced) Artificier save file looks like this: The save file has one bag that contains all objects of the Artificier. The extract command will create a new directory for all objects inside that bag. The name of the directory will be the name of the object followed by its GUID. If the object itself is a bag or deck it will create more nested directories to replicate the nesting structure from TTS. For each object multiple files are created inside their directory. A file named Data.json will contain all the data about the object, like its name, tags, etc.. The file named Script.ttslua contains the attached script. The big advantage here is that the script only contains the relevant part. In the TTS script editor you have the whole script which contains a lot of unrelated stuff and you have to find the correct place where to put the actual scripts. A file named UI.xml contains the XML UI attached to the object. The same logic as for the script applies, as it only contains a reduced view of the script (e.g. just some ). When you use the embed command from the npm section, the reverse thing will happen. The files from your current working directory will be put together and create a new save file which then will be copied back to your TTS save file folder. While doing so, all the scripts of all contained objects are automatically updated with the currently downloaded GHE scripts. E.g. many scripts have command like require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\"). What this means is: Please include the code from the file \"Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua\" at this place, computer (the same for in case of XML files). And this is what embed does. It loads the downloaded scripts and embeds them at the correct places. So the advantage is, that you only need to edit the relevant scripts and all other parts are automatically updated for you. No need to unpack nested objects inside TTS and copy/paste the same scripts over and over. If there’s an update to the releases scripts, you can use the update command from the npm section to download them. Then use embed again und all scripts are updated in the save file. NOTE While working with scripts from a beta version, make sure the following line is in your package.json, inside the devDependencies section. \"@gloomhaven-enhanced/api\": \"beta\", If you are later working with the released scripts replace beta with latest und use the update command. In addition to changing the scripts, you can also change the for all nested objects (e.g. changing its name or adding tags), by editing the Data.json of it. Be aware though that the actual name (the one you can edit in the TTS UI) is called \"Nickname\" in the file, not \"Name\". Changing \"Name\" will pretty much break the object. You can also add tags by adding and entry to the Tags property. If the data currently doesn’t have a Tags property, you can easily add one somewhere like this: { \"GUID\": \"975b2e\", \"Name\": \"Custom_Model_Infinite_Bag\", \"Nickname\": \"Tools\", \"Tags\": [ \"Tag1\", \"Tag2\" ], \"Description\": \"\" } When using the TTS scripting editor, you have to use the bundled version of the scripts. We developed the mod by splitting the scripts into different files which makes it a lot easier to maintain. However, TTS doesn’t understand that splitting and requires to have one script per object. So all files need to be bundled together into one file again for TTS to work. Normally, this would be done by the Atom plugin automatically. The scripts within the bundled folder are the result of such a bundling. The scripts then are rather big and also contain code to make the bundling work. They always look like this: -- Bundled by luabundle {\"version\":\"1.6.0\"} local __bundle_require, __bundle_loaded, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules = (function(superRequire) local loadingPlaceholder = {[{}] = true} -- .. -- lots more lines -- .. end)(require) __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- This is the relevant part require(\"Figures/CharacterMini\") -- this line also has to be removed -- The required code goes here end) __bundle_register(\"Figures/CharacterMini\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- .. -- even more lines here -- .. end) When you integrate those script you need to look for the line bundle_register(\"root\", function(require, _LOADED, bundle_register, bundle_modules). Everything between this line and the first end) is the actual script for the object. The previous line are required for the bundling to work and the following lines are the previously split files that are now put together. You don’t need to touch those. Whenever this documentation mentions to include a script onto you object, you first have to locate the correct bundled file. This is given as the title of the script example. Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua info = { hpColour = \"#5080C1\", hpTextColour = \"#B70F0F\", startingHealth = 10, } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\") E.g. here it means you have to find the Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua script within the bundled folder. Open that script and find the previously mentioned bundle_register(\"root\") line. Copy the script the documentation mentioned after this line and remove everything till the first end (excluding the end). With this example, the final script would look like this: -- Bundled by luabundle {\"version\":\"1.6.0\"} local __bundle_require, __bundle_loaded, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules = (function(superRequire) local loadingPlaceholder = {[{}] = true} -- .. -- lots more lines -- .. end)(require) __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) info = { hpColour = \"#5080C1\", hpTextColour = \"#B70F0F\", startingHealth = 10, } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\") end) __bundle_register(\"Figures/CharacterMini\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- .. -- even more lines here -- .. end) This is the script you then have to add to the object in the TTS scripting window and use the Save and Play button. The same logic applies for the UI scripts. If the example code doesn’t have a title it means there’s no bundled script available, and you have to include the script as it is provided in the example.","title":"Using the scripts","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"scripts","url":"/custom/latest/scripts.html","titles":[{"text":"Using VS Code","hash":"_using_vs_code","id":1},{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Using the TTS script editor","hash":"_using_the_tts_script_editor","id":4}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"The Enhancement Tool helps in creating the data for enhancements marks on class abilities. It generates the required scripts that needs to be added to a class registration, so that it can be picked up by the Enhancement Calculator. Additively load the tool into FHE or GHE while the class envelope is also on the table. Open the menu Options Game Keys and bind the Game Key \"Enhancement Tool: Add location\". This key is used to mark a location on an ability card while hovering it with the mouse. So something like left CTRL might work well. Right-click the class envelope and use the Setup Enhancements menu. This menu will copy all cards from the \"Starting Abilities\" and \"Advanced Abilities\" deck of the class envelope and move it to the tool. The camera will adjust to focus on the tool. While the deck is on the tool, you can use the Next button to move the top card from the deck, to the second position of the tool. This will then be the current card where enhancements can be edited. Clicking the Next button again, will move this card to the bottom of the deck and move the top card from the deck to the second slot again. The Previous button will do the reverse (place the current card on top of the deck and getting the new card from the bottom of the deck). Don’t draw or place cards manually and always use one of the buttons. The current card can than be edited by using the previously defined Game Key. Hover the card with the mouse and use the Game Key. A red cross-hair icon will appear on the card. This represents the location where the Enhancement Calculator will place the enhancement stickers later on. If you are not happy with the location, e.g. because it’s too war away from the actual spot, simply use the Game Key again and the cross-hair will move to the new place. Once you selected a current location this way, the tool will show additional options on the right to configure the enhancement spot. On the top you can see two buttons to define the current action (top/bottom) as a loss action or permanent action. In Frosthaven the enhancement price is dependent on this. Once you click them, they lighten up a bit to indicate they are currently active. Clicking them again, will remove the setting for the current action. Below, you find a checkbox that can be selected to indicate that the ability for the enhancement spot can potentially affect multiple figures/tiles/etc. Finally, there are buttons to define the shape of the enhancement spot. This defines which enhancement stickers can be put onto the enhancement spot. Clicking a shape will highlight it and reveal the final options for the enhancement spot. The enhancement costs depend on the type of ability, so it needs to be selected here for each enhancement spot. Use the 4 options preceded by a summon icon for enhancement spots on summons and the other for regular abilities. If an ability doesn’t fit one of the categories, use the last \"N/A\" option instead. This will prevent the +1 option to show up for this enhancement spot (e.g. see ability \"Flashing Flurry\" of Blinkblade, where a +1 doesn’t make any sense, but is technically allowed). There’s one option that can not be selected via the UI and has to be updated manually afterward: The movement of tokens (e.g. Deathwalker’s abilities). This can only be set in the generated script, by setting the type to move-token. The difference between the regular move type is that move-token won’t show Jump as a possible enhancement even for square shaped enhancements. After an option was clicked, a small icon will appear on the card indicating the previously selected shape. This will happen for all added enhancements and is retained even if the card is moved to the deck again. To remove an option again, simply use the Game Key again near the location of the icon. For hex enhancements a different view will show. Instead of selecting the ability type (since it’s not relevant for hex enhancements), instead the number of pre-printed hexes needs to be entered into a text field. Enter the number of existing hexes and click the Apply button to add the enhancement like any other. When all enhancements are done (or also before if you only want to generate partial scripts), use the Generate Script button. This will loop through the deck and read all added locations to generate the required script. You can find the script in the Notebook menu of TTS. There will be 2 notebooks: \"FHE 2.0\" and \"GHE 1.3\". The first one can be used if you are only interested using the class in Frosthaven Enhanced (and also Gloomhaven Enhanced once it reaches version 2.0). The other one can be used for both version as it also includes both the new format for enhancements, and the old format used by version 1.3 of GHE. Update the script of the class envelope to include the generated script and the class is ready to go. ClassApi.registerClass(\"MyClass\", { -- ... abilities = --- generated Script start { [\"Ability 1\"] = { -- ... } } --- generated Script end }) The script will set the ability level for all abilities based on the position of the card inside the deck sheet. The last two cards in the sheet will be considered to be level 9 cards, the next two cards level 8 cards and so on. The three cards before level 2 cards are then \"X\" cards and everything else will be a level 1 card. If this assumption is not correct for the class, you need to update the generated script afterward by adjusting the level property of each ability. Otherwise, the campaign manager might incorrectly load the class. The order in the deck on the table doesn’t matter. Only the order of the cards in the deck sheet is considered.","title":"Enhancement Tool","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"enhancementTool","url":"/custom/latest/tools/enhancementTool.html","titles":[]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"The section tool can be used to create PDF books with hidden sections that need to revealed via a button press. The tool is directly integrated into the GHE mod and can be used from there. To get started using the tool you first need a suitable object to work with. The object needs to have a required(\"Components.SectionBook\") Lua script attached, and it needs to be a custom PDF. To get started, you should first assign a hotkey for the tool. Open the Options Game Keys menu and assign a hotkey for \"Section Tool Add Point\" and \"Section Tool Undo Last Action\". Once this is done, place the book somewhere on the table and enter >section-tool-start into the chat window, while hovering over the book. This will start the edit mode for this book. You can now create hidden sections by \"drawing\" a rectangle with the \"Add Point\" hotkey. Move your cursor to the top left position of the rectangle you want to create and hit the \"Add Point\" hotkey. The ping arrow will show up to signal it was registered. Then move your cursor to the bottom right position of the rectangle and press the hotkey again. Again, the ping arrow will show up. Additionally, the created rectangle will now show up in the book as a black section with a button in its center. The button contains the id of the section and is auto-generated. The first part of the id is the current page number of the book and the second part is a letter. This letter will always count up by one to represent the number of created sections for this page. You can switch between the pages of the book, to create sections for the different pages. Once all sections you want to create are created, or you simply want to save your progress, enter >section-tool-save into the chat window while hovering over the book. This will save the created sections in the book, otherwise those are always temporary. The \"Section Tool Undo Last Action\" hotkey is useful to quickly undo small mistakes. When pressed after you created a rectangle it will remove the rectangle again, so you can redraw it. When pressed after setting the top left point of the rectangle it will remove the point internally, and you need to set it again. It’s currently not possible to undo more than one rectangle creation. The created section book can then be used in scenario definitions.","title":"Section Tool","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"sectionTool","url":"/custom/latest/tools/sectionTool.html","titles":[{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":1}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Actions are a mechanic to describe what you want the mod to do, without needing to script it. So you can define what you want to do and the mod then figures out how it will do it. It will also figure out, how an action is represented (e.g. through a button the user can click on). Currently, the only place where actions can be defined is in the scenario definition for overlay tiles. When an action is defined there, the overlay will automatically create a button which executes the action when a user clicks on them. You’ll probably know those button from doors and treasure chests, but they can be on any other overlay as well and do any other action as well (e.g. a treasure chest can be a door). In the future there will probably be other places as well where actions can be defined, e.g. a typical use-case would be something happens when an enemy is defeated. Every action can set following attributes which defines how the button for the action will be shown. Each action type also defines defaults for those values, so you don’t have to always set them (e.g. the name for a door action will be \"Open\" by default). The different types of actions will be listed in the following sections. Attributes name The name of the action, which will also be shown as the text on the button. style Defines the visual style for the button. This defines the background color, the font size and the width of the button that is created for the action. confirm If set to true, a user has to confirm the action again, after clicking the button for this action. Otherwise, clicking the button directly executes the action. Example The following example shows an action in the context of a scenario definition. Here the action is attached to a pressure plate tile. It will create a button with the text \"Clockwise\" that executes a call action, when clicked. rooms = { [1] = { overlayTiles = { { bag = ScenarioApi.OverlayType.Corridor, type = { { name = \"Pressure Plate\", tiles = { { position = { - 1.53, 1.88, 7.85}, rotation = {0.00, 30.00, 0.00}, tokens = { \"b\" }, action = { name = \"Clockwise\", call = { functionName = \"rotate100\", parameters = { 1 }, } }, } }, } }, } }, } } The door action is used to open rooms within the current scenario, just like the regular doors do. Objects with a door action attached are still only considered to be part of the room they are defined in. E.g. a regular door defined in the doorTiles section of a scenario will also spawn, when one of the adjacent rooms is opened. An object with the door action will only spawn, when the room where it is defined is opened. To get the regular door behaviour the object has to be defined in multiple rooms with the same settings. It will still only spawn once, since a spawning object will be ignored, when there’s already an object with the same name at the target location. Defaults name Open style Door confirm true Attributes Name Required Type Description rooms required List The list of room numbers that will be opened when this action is performed. Only rooms that weren’t opened before will be opened. Example action = { rooms = { 6, 2 } } The treasure action will reveal a treasure card and then destroy the object the action is attached to. Treasure cards will be searched for in the treasure deck or the bag containing additional treasure (see Treasure for details on how to add custom treasure). Defaults name The value of the treasure attribute style Treasure confirm false Attributes Name Required Type Description treasure required Number or String The name of the treasure that will be revealed. If the name is \"G\" the object is considered a goal treasure. No card is revealed and the object will not be destroyed when the action is performed.

Defaults name Execute style Pressure Plate confirm false Attributes Attributes Name Required Type Description spawn required [Spawnable Element] Defines the object that will be spawned.

This action is used to remove existing objects from the scenario. This can be useful for things like hidden rooms. Defaults name Execute style Pressure Plate confirm false Attributes Name Required Type Description remove required Element Search Defines which element should be removed. Name Required Type Description name optional String The exact name of the object to remove. If tag is also set only elements with the tag will be considered. tag optional String The tag of the object to remove. If name is not set all objects with this tag will be removed. Example action = { remove = { tag = \"Extra\", } } This action is used for scenario sections. Currently, the only thing it does is to set the color tint of the object it is attached to, so a black colored section tile will be revealed. Defaults name \"Section \" plus the value of the section attribute style Section confirm false Attributes Name Required Type Description section required Number or String The section that will be revealed. Example action = { section = 68, } This is a container action that combines multiple actions into one action. The content of this action is a list of the containing actions.

The most typical use-case would be HP values of obstacles or enemies that scale with the number of characters or the current scenario level. Formulas are defined with Lua tables. The first entry is the operator that is used and the following entries are the arguments for the operator, which itself are formulas. Every number is a formula in itself, so wherever a formula is required, a number can also be provided. Strings in formulas are considered to be variables and will be resolved in the given context (e.g. \"L\" or \"C\" like in the scenario book). Which variables are available depends on the context where the formula is used (see below). Arguments can be formulas, too which is used to E.g. the expression 2 + 4 * 5 would be defined as this formula; { \"+\", 2, { \"*\", 4, 5 } } --> resolves to 22 This shows that formulas are resolved from inner to outer. Before an operator can be executed all its arguments have to be resolved first. So in order for the addition to work, the multiplication formula will be resolved first. Looking at the Examples the usage should get clearer. :-) Operator Arguments Description + List Adds the resolved formula values. - List Subtracts the resolved formula values (left to right). * List Multiplies the resolved formula values. / List Divides the resolved formula values (left to right). roundUp Formula Rounds the resolved formula value up. roundDown Formula Rounds the resolved formula value down. apply 2 or 3 Calls a function and returns the function’s value. The name of the function is the first argument. If the second argument is a String, this is the GUID of the object that contains the function. Then the third argument is the table of parameters passed to the function. Otherwise, the second argument is the table of parameters passed to the function and the function has to be on the object that defines the formula. Variables within the parameters will also be resolved. if A List with 3 Formula Checks if the first argument value is true. If this is the case, it will return the second argument’s value, otherwise it will return the third argument’s value. byScenarioLevel List Return the formula Variable Context Description C All The number of player characters. L All The current scenario level. H Enemies The standard HP value for the enemy at the current scenario level and difficulty. self All The GUID of the object for which the formula is calculated. Global All A reference to the Global object. Every number is a formula in itself, to it can be used directly. hp = 4 Variables are also a formula in itself. hp = \"L\" The four basic arithmetic operators can be used like this: hp = { \"+\", \"C\", 3} -- C + 3 hp = { \"-\", \"C\", 3} -- C - 3 hp = { \"*\", \"H\", 2} -- H * 2 hp = { \"/\", \"H\", 2} -- H / 2 Multiple operators can be combined with an argument as a formula table. hp = { \"+\", 20, \"L\", {\"*\", 2, \"C\"}, } -- 20 + L + (2 * C) With division rounding is also relevant. hp = { \"roundUp\", { \"/\", {\"*\", \"H\", \"C\"}, 2 } } -- (H * C) / 2, rounded up To mimic monster stats it’s possible to use the byScenarioLevel operator. It returns the value from the argument afterwards, that matches the current scenario level. E.g. the following formula would return 1 for scenario level 0 and 1, 2 for scenario level 2 and so forth: hp = { \"byScenarioLevel\", 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } Functions can be called, too. Since Strings are considered to be variables, they have to be prefixed with a $ if the literal String is meant (e.g. for the function name to be called). This also applies for all values inside the parameters of the apply operator. E.g. this example will set the HP value of the object the formula is attached to, to the same value as the \"Prime Demon\" enemy has. hp = { \"apply\", \"$setHealthFromEnemy\", \"Global\", { enemy = \"$Prime Demon\", object = \"self\" }, } It might be useful to combine the if operator with the apply operator. E.g. this example will either resolve to the value 0 or 1, depending on whether the current party has the \"Dimensional Equilibrium\" achievement or not (which is checked by the hasPartyAchievement function). levelModifier = { \"if\", { \"apply\", \"$hasPartyAchievement\", \"Global\", { name = \"$Dimensional Equilibrium\" }, }, 0, 1 }","title":"Formula","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"formula","url":"/custom/latest/common/formula.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Operators","hash":"_available_operators","id":1},{"text":"Available Variables","hash":"_available_variables","id":2},{"text":"Examples","hash":"Example_Formula","id":3}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Spawnable elements are a way to define objects that can be spawned by certain actions. They define which objects should be created and what properties they should have. The mod uses the information to pull the correct object and apply the properties to it. Currently they can be used to define the content for the Context Menu as well as for the Spawn Action within a scenario definition. Each Spawnable Element definition has two required properties: The type of the element (e.g. an obstacle, trap, enemy, etc.) and it’s name. The type tells the mod where to look for the object and the name determines which object from that place it spawns. Both those properties are defined within the element property. To get access to the different types, use the ElementType table in the ResourceApi (as seen in the example). Example 1. Definition for a Boulder obstacle local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Obstacle, name = \"Boulder\", } } There are also additional properties that can be set for all elements that support them (most overlays do). E.g. conditions, current/maximum HP or scenario aid tokens. Example 2. Additional properties for an element local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Obstacle, name = \"Boulder\", -- Add the scenario aid tokens A and B to the object tokens = {\"a\", \"b\"}, -- Add the Wound condition to the object conditions = {\"Wound\"}, -- sets the current HP. If hpMax is not used, this is also the maximum HP hp = 3, -- sets the maximum HP hpMax = { \"+\", \"C\", 1}, } } The properties hp and hpMax can be a Formula. Some elements, like traps and enemies, also have additional properties. Example 3. Definition for a trap with damage and conditions local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Bear Trap\", conditions = { \"Stun\" }, -- Defines the amount of damage this trap does damage = 3, } } Example 4. Definition for a summonable enemy local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"Living Bones\", -- Spawns at elite difficulty. If not used, \"normal\" is the default difficulty = \"elite\", } } To make Spawnable Elements appear in the Context Menu, they have to be added to the ability information of the class or enemy which can create them, by using the spawn property. For classes this is part of the class information used for registerClass. Example 5. Definition within a class ability local ClassApi = require(\"api.ClassApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") ClassApi.registerClass(\"Doomstalker\", { abilities = { [\"Detonation\"] = { level = 1, enhancements = {}, spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, } } } }, } } Currently, the element will show up in the Context Menu, if the ability is somewhere present on the table (so not necessarily if it was placed for the current round). The tooltip in the Context Menu will show which ability defined the element, so it’s easier for users to spawn the correct one. It’s also possible to define Spawnable Elements on the top level of a class definition. Then the element will always show up in the Context Menu regardless of which ability is present. This is useful if the class has lots abilities that spawn the same element. Using the definition in the abilities would clutter the Context Menu with multiple entries of the same element, so this is a way to prevent that. Example 6. Definition within a class local ClassApi = require(\"api.ClassApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") ClassApi.registerClass(\"Doomstalker\", { spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, } } } }) For enemies this is done in the ability deck definition used for registerEnemyAbilityDeck. Example 7. Definition within an enemy ability deck local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck(\"Archer\", { abilities = { [7] = { image = \"...\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, }, } }, }, Defining the elements for bosses works the same, though they use a different API. Example 8. Definition within a boss local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy(\"Human Commander\", { icon = \"...\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"City Guard\", }, }, { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"City Archer\", }, }, } }) In all instances above, the spawn property is a list of elements, so its possible to put multiple elements in there (as can be seen in the boss example). Be sure to use the correct number of nesting levels of { } even when using only 1 element. In addition to the element property, Spawnable Elements also have an optional action property, where you can define Actions. This can be useful, when using the Spawn Action in a scenario definition. E.g. there are scenarios with secret rooms that get revealed when a button is pressed. The button creates a door object to the new secret room, by using the Spawn Action. The action within the Spawnable Element then defines, that the newly spawned door object will really have the \"Open\" button attached to it. Otherwise it would just be a token. Example 9. Definition of an overlay that also acts as a door local spawnableElement = { element = { type = Scenario.OverlayType.Door, name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", }, action = { -- open Room 2 and 6 of the scenario, when the button is pressed rooms = {6, 2} }, }, While this is currently only used in scenario definitions, it’s also possible to use that feature for the objects in the Context Menu (a class that can spawn doors, how cool would that be?). The final property of a Spawnable Element is the placement property. This is used to determine where and at what rotation the new object will be spawned at. Is has two properties position and rotation, which each take a 3 dimensional vector of the absolute position/rotation within TTS. Example 10. Defining the placement of an object local spawnableElement = { element = { type = Scenario.OverlayType.Door, name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", }, action = { rooms = {6, 2} }, placement = { position = { -3.03, 1.77, 21.00}, rotation = { 0, 210, 0 }, }, }, When using the element for the Context Menu this property is not required and actually ignored, because spawning from the Context Menu has it’s own logic to determine the position for the object. To easily get that information, after you placed an object somewhere on the table, use the Command Line, to print it to the screen (and the Atom console, where you can easily copy it from).","title":"Spawnable Element","component":"custom","version":"2","name":"spawnable","url":"/custom/latest/common/spawnable.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining a Spawnable Element","hash":"_defining_a_spawnable_element","id":1},{"text":"Using Spawnable Elements for the Context Menu","hash":"_using_spawnable_elements_for_the_context_menu","id":2},{"text":"Adding actions","hash":"_adding_actions","id":3},{"text":"Defining the placement of the new object","hash":"_defining_the_placement_of_the_new_object","id":4}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Add the information for the tracker image directly to the class' data.

By default, this comes with a command line tool and a bare-bones UI. It’s recommended to also install other tools that offer better UIs to effectively work with git, like GitHub Desktop or the integration in editors like Visual Studio Code node.js An engine to execute JavaScript/TypeScript code. Most tools surrounding the mod are written with TypeScript so this needs to be installed to execute them. pnpm A package manager for external libraries used by the tools. Also mainly used to actually start the different tools from a command line. Visual Studio Code A multipurpose text-editor/development tool. Makes it easier to read and write the mod’s code and work with the tools. Also has extensions that make it integrate into TTS directly, like this one. Inside the TTS save game directory create the following files: Enginehaven_Dev.json Frosthaven_Dev.json The content doesn’t matter, just their existence is important. After installing everything, clone the repository with git somewhere on your local filesystem. If you use the command line to clone, be sure to include the following flag: git clone --recurse-submodules Otherwise, run the following command after cloning the repository: git submodule update --init --recursive Then run the command pnpm install via a command line. This will install the external dependencies required for the tools in the repository. It will also probably show some warnings which will be fixed automatically later on. Then, run the command pnpm build via a command line. This will build the tools on your local file system so they are ready to use. Finally, run the command pnpm install again. Whenever you perform a git pull to get the latest changes from GitHub, a pnpm install will typically be automatically executed if it is required. It’s also recommended to execute the pnpm build command again then to build any updates to the tools. This is not done automatically. To create the latest save games of the mod based on the current state of the repository, run the command pnpm embed:fh. This will fill the previously created files Enginehaven_Dev.json and Frosthaven_Dev.json with actual TTS save files. Load the save Enginehaven_Dev inside TTS. Then additively load Frosthaven_Dev.

The list of available Game Keys can be found while accessing the Options Game Keys menu. This section gives an overview of the available game actions that can be bound to a key. Each player has to assign the Game Key themselves if they want to use it. There’s no way to share assigned Game Keys or assign default keys in the mod. Assigned keys will stay between mod versions. When migrating from 2.0.0 to v2.1.0 or beyond, the Quick Menu and the Cleanup Action have been renamed and must be re-mapped by all users. Assigning a Game Key does not prevent the TTS default behavior for that key. E.g. if you assign the key \"F\" to a Game Key and use it while hovering over an object, it will still flip the object in addition to performing the game action. However, as stated above, this means those keys have to reassigned for each player, if they want to use them again. The two most useful Game Keys are the Quick Menu and the Cleanup Action. While hovering over a character ability card, this will open the Enhancement Calculator. While hovering over a card in a player’s hand, these keys will place this card in the 1st/2nd/3rd ability card slot on the Play Area. If there’s already a card present, it will be moved to the player’s hand again. This also works regardless of player color. E.g. if you are the Black player and use this Game Key while hovering over a hand zone card for the Blue player, it will move the cards to the slot for the Blue player. In addition to the Game Key you set here, the numbers at the top of the keyboard 1, 2, and 3 will set cards in their respective card slots on the Play Area. While hovering over an ability card, this Game Key will move the card to the discard pile or the next free spot in the active area. Those Game Keys are mainly meant when using Picture in Picture mode on the player mat. Buttons don’t work inside the PiP window, but Game Keys do. This key will sort your hand in numerical order. When playing solo, it will sort only the active hand when pressed. Geminate’s hand does not split the sort into its two forms at this time. While hovering a deck or a bag, this Game Key will open the Search Window for this container. This key will undo the most recent deletion. Accidentally delete a battle goal instead of returning it to the deck? Hit this key. This key will toggle the terrain type highlighted. At this time, the function is not extended beyond use in Scenario 0. While hovering over a figure or token with a health bar, this key will add/remove one health from it. While hovering over a character, this key will add/remove one XP. While hovering over a character figure that has a stance bar, this key will move the active stance to the left or right. While hovering over a character figure that has a resource bar, this key will add or remove a resource from the specific resource bar. This action will draw a new Attack Modifier card from the enemy deck. This key switches the player color to the next available player color that has a character loaded. This is intended for solo or multi-handed play. These actions quickly switch to the player seat associated with this player number. For the Solo player it will switch to the Black player color. The switch is only successful if there isn’t already another player seated for this player color. Unfortunately there’s no way to preserve the current camera position before switching. So instead of defaulting to moving the camera far away like, the camera will focus on the character mat for this player instead. The camera behavior is the same as the one mentioned in the \"Switch To Player\" section. Useful for behind the scenes scripting and tinkering, particularly with blocking out specific section reads.","title":"Game Keys","component":"mod","version":"2.1","name":"gameKeys","url":"/mod/latest/engine/feature/gameKeys.html","titles":[{"text":"The 2 Most Useful Game Keys: Quick Menu and Cleanup Action","hash":"_the_2_most_useful_game_keys_quick_menu_and_cleanup_action","id":1},{"text":"Enhance Ability","hash":"_enhance_ability","id":2},{"text":"Play 1st/2nd/3rd Ability Card","hash":"_play_1st2nd_card","id":3},{"text":"Discard Ability/Make Ability Active","hash":"_discard_abilitymake_ability_active","id":4},{"text":"Sort Hand","hash":"_sort_hand","id":5},{"text":"Open Search","hash":"_open_search","id":6},{"text":"Undo Deletion","hash":"_undo_deletion","id":7},{"text":"Toggle Terrain Outline","hash":"_toggle_terrain_outline","id":8},{"text":"Add/Remove Health","hash":"_addremove_health","id":9},{"text":"Add/Remove XP","hash":"_addremove_xp","id":10},{"text":"Next Stance/Previous Stance","hash":"_next_stanceprevious_stance","id":11},{"text":"Add/Remove Resource 1/2/3","hash":"_addremove_resource_123","id":12},{"text":"Draw Monster Attack Modifier","hash":"_draw_monster_attack_modifier","id":13},{"text":"Switch To Next Character","hash":"_switch_to_next_character","id":14},{"text":"Switch To Player 1/2/3/4/5/Solo Player","hash":"switch_player","id":15},{"text":"Section Tools","hash":"_section_tools","id":16}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"The Quick Menu is a quick access menu to easily apply conditions to figures and summon figure specific tokens (like traps, enemies or obstacles).

Clicking on any of the conditions will apply it to the figure for which to Quick Menu was opened and closes the Quick Menu again. Right-Clicking will do the same, but the Quick Menu stays open afterward, which is useful to apply multiple conditions. Above the icons for conditions, the icons for active classes are shown. This allows to apply the class tracker as a condition to the underlying figure. Only the trackers for classes are shown that are currently available on one of the player seats. Lastly, for some figures the top row shows icons for figure specific items that can be spawned. This includes summons for characters and monsters, any overlay tiles created by the character or monster, or any character-specific tokens (i.e. Deathwalker Shadows). Enemies that create traps will also spawn traps from the Quick Menu with the correct damage or conditions indicators on top of them. Clicking the icon will spawn the token above the figure’s head. From there it can be dragged to the place where it needs to be (without requiring to unlock it first). This might be considered a slight spoiler for enemies. Summonable monsters will always show up for an enemy, even if the ability card that allows the spawn was not drawn yet.

This determines how the scenario book is treated when a new scenario is loaded. It can be one of following options: Spawn When this option is set, a new scenario book will be spawned whenever a scenario is loaded. This tile only contains the 1 or 2 pages for the scenario and not the complete scenario book. They can be deleted once they are no longer needed. Change If the scenario book is already present somewhere on the table, it’s page will be set to the page of the scenario, once it is loaded. If the scenario book is not on the table, nothing happens.

Specifies whether hidden room scenario should be used, when setting up a scenario. 3D Models are expected to be incorporated in a future version of Frosthaven Enhanced. Specifies for which overlay tokens 3D models should be used. These options are available: Closed Doors If set, all door token that is not opened yet use the 3D model, otherwise they use the 2D token. Opened Doors Once a door was opened, it switches to the 2D token if this is not set. Trees If not set, tree tokens will use the 2D token. Otherwise, they will use one of available tree 3D on random. Other Specifies the behavior for all other types of overlays. Use particle effects When this is unchecked, particle effects (animations) are removed from all 3D models. When this option is set, all enemies will be prepared when starting a new scenario. This will speed up the flow of the scenario, but might spoil some parts if used together with the hidden room scenario. If this option is not set, enemies will only be prepared once a room is opened where they are present. Defined how many Battle Goals will be dealt at the start of a scenario. Frosthaven rules call for 3 to be dealt at the start of a scenario, which is the default setting. Can be set to 0 so that they have to be drawn manually. When this option is set, ability cards placed with the play ability card Game Keys are placed face-down. Otherwise, they are placed face-up. Determines if summoned monsters should drop loot (e.g. coins) or not. All Frosthaven monsters drop loot tokens unless scenario rules say otherwise. Always Summoned monsters will always drop loot. Never Summoned monsters will never drop any loot. Campaign Based Summoned monsters will drop loot based on the rules of the scenario for the current campaign (Are you playing Gloomhaven or Frosthaven?). If you are playing Gloomhaven, summoned mosnters will not drop loot. If you are playing Frosthaven, summoned monsters will drop loot tokens. More information on Variants can be found on page 69 of the rulebook. This option can be used to specify playing a solo game or a co-op game with open information. This will reduce the gold conversion and bonus experience by one level at the end of a scenario while keeping the monster level and trap damage intact. So with solo play it’s intended to add the +1 for the scenario level and use this option to reduce gold conversion and bonus experience down again.
