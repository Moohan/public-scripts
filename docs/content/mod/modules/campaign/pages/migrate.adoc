= Migrating a Campaign

There are two reasons to migrate a campaign.

== Migrating from Frosthaven Assisted
Potential feature to be outlined here at a later date
//Nerdhaven to provide information

[#migrating]
== Migrating from a previous version of Frosthaven Enhanced
When playing Frosthaven Enhanced, simply create a Tabletop Simulator save file and re-load every time you need to close Tabletop Simulator.
This will be kept under the "Save and Load" tab of Games.
When a new version of Frosthaven Enhanced is released and you would like to migrate to the newer version of Frosthaven Enhanced, use the Campaign Manager.

* Click on "Games" on the top menu, and load a new Frosthaven Enhanced mod from the Workshop tab
* In an empty Frosthaven Enhanced mod, select "Objects" from the top menu, then Saved Objects, and track down the Object you saved in step 4
* Place one instance of the object on the table and right-click to return to basic mouse use/movement
* Click and drag the object into the skull spot in the center of the Campaign Manager and the new version of Frosthaven Enhanced

Once completed, all information will be migrated to the current version of Frosthaven Enhanced!
