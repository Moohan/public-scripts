= Custom Content Integration

This documentation describes how custom content can be integrated into the Frosthaven Enhanced mod.

A lot has changes since the 1.3 version of the mod on how custom content could and should be created.
Therefore, this documentation is still work in progress.

The main concept to add any custom content to the mod is using a xref:contentbox.adoc[content box].
