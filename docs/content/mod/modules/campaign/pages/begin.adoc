Available Items:: This is where the unlocked items are stored. Left click btn:[Unpack/Recall] to place all available items in the shop area, which is above the play area.
Check out the btn:[Item Shop] for sorting the available items in the shop area. Be sure to right click btn:[Unpack/Recall] when you are done shopping to recall the items to the item storage bag.
This allows for fewer images to load and allows the mod to perform better.
