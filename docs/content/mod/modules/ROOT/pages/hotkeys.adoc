= Game Keys

Game Keys are a concept of TTS, where players can assign a key on their keyboard to perform a specific action in the game.
The list of available Game Keys can be found while accessing the menu:Options[Game Keys] menu.
This section gives an overview of the available game actions that can be bound to a key.

Each player has to assign the Game Key themself if they want to use it.
There's no way to share assigned  Game Keys or assign default keys in the mod.
Assigned keys will stay between mod versions.

NOTE: Assigning a Game Key does not prevent the TTS default behavior for that key. E.g. if you assign the key "F" to a Game Key and use it while hovering over an object, it will still flip the object in addition to performing the game action.

NOTE: Until version 1.2 of the mod, some of the Game Keys listed here where automatically bound to so-called scripting keys (typically the first numbers on the numpad).
This was removed in version 1.3 in favor of using Game Keys.
However, as stated above, this means those keys have to reassigned for each player, if they want to use them again.


== Add/Remove Health
While hovering over a figure or token with a health bar (e.g. including obstacles or doors in some scenarios), this action will add/remove one health from it.

== Show Context Menu
While hovering over a figure (enemy, character, summon) this action will show the xref:contextMenu.adoc[Context Menu] for it which allows to quickly apply conditions or summon figure relevant tokens.

== Loot
While hovering over a coin or treasure chest token, this action will move it the the player mat of the player who used that action.
This also means it currently doesn't work while using the Black player for solo play.

== Defeat Monster
While hovering over an enemy figure, this action will remove the figure and spawn a coin token in it's place (unless it was a summon).
This is the same behavior as reducing the enemies health to 0 and then pressing the "Defeat" button in the center of it's health bar.
However, this action will also be performed, if the enemies health is above 0.

== Draw Monster Attack Modifier
This action will draw a new Attack Modifier card from the enemy deck.


== Play 1st/2nd Card
While hovering over a card in a player's hand, this action will place this card in the 1st/2nd ability card slot on the Play Area.
If there's already a card present, it will be moved to the player's hand again.
This also works regardless of player color.
E.g. if you are the Black player and use this hotkey while hovering over a hand zone card for the Blue player, it will move the cards to the slot for the Blue player.


== Switch To Player 1/2/3/4/Solo Player
These actions quickly switch to the player seat associated with this player number.
For the Solo player it will switch to the Black player color.
The switch is only successful if there isn't already another player seated for this player color.

Unfortunately there's no way to preserve the current camera position before switching.
So instead of defaulting to moving the camera far away like, the camera will focus on the character mat for this player instead.

== Switch To Next Character
This action switches the player color to the next available player color, that also has a character loaded.
This is intended for solo or multi-handed play.

The camera behavior is the same as the one mentioned in the "Switch To Player" section.
