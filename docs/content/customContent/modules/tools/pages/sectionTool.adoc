= Section Tool

The section tool can be used to create PDF books with hidden sections that need to revealed via a button press.
The tool is directly integrated into the GHE mod and can be used from there.

== Usage

To get started using the tool you first need a suitable object to work with.
The object needs to have a `required("Components.SectionBook")` Lua script attached, and it needs to be a custom PDF.

To get started, you should first assign a hotkey for the tool.
Open the menu:Options[Game Keys] menu and assign a hotkey for "Section Tool Add Point" and "Section Tool Undo Last Action".

Once this is done, place the book somewhere on the table and enter `>section-tool-start` into the chat window, while hovering over the book.
This will start the edit mode for this book.
You can now create hidden sections by "drawing" a rectangle with the "Add Point" hotkey.
Move your cursor to the top left position of the rectangle you want to create and hit the "Add Point" hotkey.
The ping arrow will show up to signal it was registered.
Then move your cursor to the bottom right position of the rectangle and press the hotkey again.
Again, the ping arrow will show up.
Additionally, the created rectangle will now show up in the book as a black section with a button in its center.
The button contains the id of the section and is auto-generated.
The first part of the id is the current page number of the book and the second part is a letter.
This letter will always count up by one to represent the number of created sections for this page.
You can switch between the pages of the book, to create sections for the different pages.

Once all sections you want to create are created, or you simply want to save your progress, enter `>section-tool-save` into the chat window while hovering over the book.
This will save the created sections in the book, otherwise those are always temporary.

The "Section Tool Undo Last Action" hotkey is useful to quickly undo small mistakes.
When pressed after you created a rectangle it will remove the rectangle again, so you can redraw it.
When pressed after setting the top left point of the rectangle it will remove the point internally, and you need to set it again.
It's currently not possible to undo more than one rectangle creation.

The created section book can then be used in xref:ROOT:scenario.adoc#_section_books[scenario definitions].
